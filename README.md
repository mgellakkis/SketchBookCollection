# Book Collection (Book Club Mobile App)

Design an application that allows users to keep track of the books they read and own.
The application must: 

- Allow the user to login/signup to share their profile amongst multiple devices, as well as logout.
- Search a database of books, or browse by authors, publishers, or genres.
- The user must be able to select the book to see more information (Cover, Title, Author, Date published, ISBN, Rating, Page Count, Publisher, Genres, and Description).
- Allow the user to mark a book as read, as well as add it to their library. Once marked as read, the user can input their own notes of what they thought of the book, as well as set a rating.
- Allow the user to share a book with a friend via Email, Text, or Social Media (Fb, Twitter, etc).
- Allow the user to browse their library , and remove or add books
